Minimum initialized with 2
Minimum compared with 1: new value set
Smallest value removed from the heap
[
  2 -> []
]
Creating a new heap from the children of the removed node
[
  2 -> []
]
Reversing the order of the trees in the children heap
Merging the heap with the children of the removed node
Merge step 1: adding all binomial trees to a single heap
[
  2 -> []
]
[
  2 -> []
  2 -> []
]
Merge step 2: merging the trees of same degree
[
  2 -> [
    2 -> []
  ]
